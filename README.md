# State Machine
Tired of highly-dependant codes, or you're having a hard time implementing new mechanics ? You've gone into the right place, this is a very simple state machine i've made so i can easily handle entities states, you can use it for: character, enemies, and literally anything that can make use of the Finite-State-Machine design pattern, it's made primarily for 2D, but it's been proved to work nicely with 3D too.

## How to install
### Package Manager (recommended)
* 1 - Open the package manager (Window > Package Manager)  
* 2 - Click on the plus icon and "Add package from git URL..."  
* 3 - Enter https://github.com/GabrielBigardi/State-Machine.git and click "Add"  
* 4 - Wait until the package manager finishes installing the package and recompiling  
   
### Lazy way
* 1 - Download this repository as ZIP or by cloning it.
* 2 - Drag it into your "Assets" folder.
  
## Why to use
### Decoupled code
* Your code gets decoupled and easier to handle.
### Better maintainable code
* When your code grows, things tends to get pretty messy and hard to maintain, FSM fix this.
### Easily Extensible and more control
* You can easily extend this FSM, for example: adding super/base-states, etc...
* You have full control of how your entities is handled.
